# Stuff to read
This is a collection of sources of interesting things to read in the penumbra of media, marketing and tech. I’ve organised it by format of delivery that I use, which might seem an odd choice, especially since some of them, like Ben Thompson’s Stratechery, are multi-format, and exist as podcast, newsletter and website. 

## Email newsletters
Bit of an old-fashioned format but some good stuff out there, including, unusually, the newsletters of the read-it-later services, which are excellent as they are informed by the reading habits of lots of people. The only way to get those is to sign up for an account for the service. 

* [Pocket newsletter](#)[1](#)
* [Instapaper newsletter](#)[2](#)
* Enders Analysis (if you have a corporate subscription)
* Forrester (ditto)
* [Ben Evans](#)[3](#)
* [Ben Thompson](#)[4](#) (well worth subscribing I think)
* [Fintellect](#)[5](#)
* [Adexchanger](#)[6](#)
* [Mobile Fix](#)[7](#)
* [Midia Research](#)[8](#)
* [ExchangeWire](#)[9](#)
* [McKinsey Highlights](#)[10](#)
* [Parse.ly email](#)[11](#)
* [Exponential View](http://www.exponentialview.co/newsletter/) (thanks Tim!)
* [HN Digest](https://hndigest.com)
* [MondayNote](https://madmimi.com/signups/203173/join)

## Entities formerly known as websites
In my case, I consume these through Apple News, as it’s a fairly competent algorithmic news feed reader that doesn’t try to show me pictures of my friends’ children. I’m sure they exist in your platform of choice (but if not, see next section).

## Things I can’t get on Apple News
GAFA results are always worth reading for the transcripts of the calls in particular. You get a good sense of what matters to them as businesses, and how they are laying out their vision for (amongst others) employees who will all be following closely.

[http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn/call-transcripts](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn/call-transcripts)

And these are all good for different reasons. The Netflix etc tech blogs are very revealing as are some corners of FB and Google. Trail of Bits are awesome.

## Recent Papers and Conference Videos
You’ll see that the URL above for Arxiv spits out an RSS feed of my favourite authors. Insert your own as appropriate, but overall it’s worth keeping an eye on Arxiv because that’s where most of this community likes to publish.

## Podcasts
Usual suspects really:

Smug but good [a16z](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/a16z/id842818711?mt=2)

I haven’t heard any yet, but Amol Rajan has a sound POV and has been given the reins to the BBC [Media Show](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-media-show/id292525828?mt=2)

Another BBC one, this time from the World Service, called [Click](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/click/id73331490?mt=2), which sometimes has Krotoski amongst other psychology types. 

Another new one from Parse.ly, which, given their data, will be worth listening to, called [The Center of Attention](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-center-of-attention/id1319543127?mt=2)

And the charming Roman Mars with [99% Invisible](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318?mt=2) is sometimes tangentially relevant. 

And Jan Dawson with his market analysis crops up in podcast form too with [Beyond Devices](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/beyond-devices-podcast/id1002197313?mt=2)
